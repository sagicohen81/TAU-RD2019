# Vehicle-main-control-unit-2019
TAURD drive by wire 
engineering graduate project - controling servo motors with a network of micro-controllers.
the micro controllers connected with CAN-BUS control each of the vehicle systems simultaneously (brakes, wheel, pedals).
a controling unit (computer or steering kit) is opertaing the whole network and connected with bluetooth to the vehicle network. 

This git contains the code for:

1. Two kind of microprocessors - main control unit and noumerous generic control units.

2. A python script for extracting live data from the steering kit (or simple computer) and communicating with the main control unit microprocessor
